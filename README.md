Pac-Man is an arcade game that first hit the scene in Japan back in 1980, thanks to Namco and designer Toru Iwatani.
The game stars Pac-Man, a cheerful, yellow character shaped like a pie with a missing slice. His mission is to munch
his way through a maze filled with dots while steering clear of four pesky ghosts named Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde.
